    "# Goal of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to control a 2D quadrotor to get it to perform acrobatic moves. The controllers will be designed using the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2D quadrotor\n",
    "\n",
    "The quadrotor is depicted in the following figure <img src='quadrotor.png' width=\"300\">\n",
    "The quadrotor model is written as\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} \n",
    "\\dot{x} &= v_x\\\\\n",
    "m \\dot{v}_x &= - (u_1 + u_2) \\sin \\theta \\\\ \n",
    "\\dot{y} &= v_y\\\\\n",
    "m \\dot{v}_y &= (u_1 + u_2) \\cos \\theta  - m g\\\\\n",
    "\\dot{\\theta} &= \\omega\\\\\n",
    "I \\dot{\\omega} &= r (u_1 - u_2) \\end{align}$$\n",
    "where $x$ is the horizontal and $y$ the vertical positions of the quadrotor and $\\theta$ is its orientation with respect to the horizontal plane. $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the linear velocities and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the robot. $u_1$ and $u_2$ are the forces produced by the rotors (our control inputs). $m$ is the quadrotor mass, $I$ its moment of inertia (a scalar), $r$ is the distance from the center of the robot frame to the propellers and $g$ is the gravity constant. To denote the entire state, we will write $z = [x, v_x, y, v_y, \\theta, \\omega]^T$ - we will also write $u = [u_1, u_2]^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module ```quadrotor.py``` defines the class ```Quadrotor``` that provides all the useful information about the robot and methods to simulate and animate it as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write the answer to all questions that are not asking for code in the report (as a single pdf file). Please submit your code as runnable Jupyter Notebooks (one for each part) or as runnable python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 - Setting up\n",
    "1. Discretize the system dynamics using the Euler method seen in class - write the time discretization step as $\\Delta t$ (use symbols not numbers for the mass, etc)\n",
    "2. Assume that robot starts at an arbitrary position $x(0) = x_0$, $y(0) = y_0$ and $\\theta(0) = 0$ with 0 velocities. Compute $u_1^*$ and $u_2^*$ such that the robot stays at this position forever after (you may test your answer using the simulation below).\n",
    "3. Analyzing the system dynamics, is it possible to move in the x direction while keeping $\\theta = 0$? Explain why.\n",
    "4. Analyzing the system dynamics, is it possible to have the system at rest with $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (i.e. have the quadrotor in a vertical position)? Explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 - LQR to stay in place\n",
    "Now that we have $u^*$ capable of keeping the robot at rest, we can design a simple controller that ensures that the robot stays in place even when pushed around by random disturbances (e.g. due to the wind). Our task here will be to design a LQR controller that keeps the robot at a predefined position. Since the dynamics is not linear, we need to compute a linear approximation of it.\n",
    "1. Linearize the dynamics at an arbitrary operating point $\\bar{z}$, $\\bar{u}$ and write the linearized system dynamics using the variables $\\hat{z}_n = z_n - \\bar{z}$ and $\\hat{u}_n = u_n - \\bar{u}$.\n",
    "2. Write a function ```get_linearization(robot, z, u)``` that returns the matrices A and B given a robot (object of type ```Quadrotor```), a state z and a control u.\n",
    "3. Using the linearized dynamics, we can design an infinite horizon LQR controller of the form, $\\hat{u} = K \\hat{z}$ to stabilize the resting point. What will be the actual controller in the original coordinates $u$ as a function of $z$?\n",
    "4. Design such an infinite-horizon LQR controller to stabilize the origin $z=0$ and test it using the simulator below (Explain your intended design in the report, including the cost function and found control law). In particular, verify that it can handle perturbations by calling the ```simulate``` function with ```disturbance = True``` (when setting disturbance to True, the simulator will generate a random perturbation every 1 second). Simulate your controller for 10 seconds, plot the state evolution and show the animation (show the plots in your report).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 - following a trajectory using linearized dynamics\n",
    "Now we want to follow a given trajectory leveraging a linearized version of the dynamics to design LQ controllers.\n",
    "1. Assume that we want to follow a circle of radius 1 centered at (0,0) while keeping an orientation $\\theta=0$, how does the linearization of the dynamics change along the desired trajectory? Why?\n",
    "2. Design a tracking controller (using an LQ design) to follow this desired trajectory (Explain your design in the report). \n",
    "3. Test the tracking controller with the simulation (with and without the perturbations) and verify that you can indeed track the (x,y) trajectory very well. Are you able to also track $\\theta$? (Explain) Analyze your results (including plots of the states, controls, etc). What benefits and issues do you see with this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4 - iterative LQR\n",
    "Now we would like to do more complicated motions with the robot, like a flip. In this case, we do not have a prescribed trajectory but we would like to compute a locally optimal trajectory together with the controller. We will design an iterative LQR algorithm to solve this problem.\n",
    "1. For the first task, we want the robot to reach a vertical orientation $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ at the location $x=3$ and $y=3$ at time $t=5$ starting from $z_0=0$. During the rest of the motion, the robot should try and stay close to the origin. It should also try to keep its control $u$ close to the control needed to keep the robot at rest. We want to make sure the robot reaches the origin $z=0$ at the end of the movement. Find a time-varying cost function that promotes such a behavior (use only quadratic/linear terms for simplicity). Assume $T=10$ seconds.\n",
    "2. Write a function ```compute_cost(z,u, horizon_length)``` that returns the cost of a trajectory z with control trajectory u.\n",
    "3. Compute the quadratic approximation of your cost function along a trajectory $z_n$ with control trajectory $u_n$ (this is not just your cost function!)\n",
    "4. Write a function ```get_quadratic_approximation_cost(z, u, horizon_length)``` that returns the quadratic approximation (Hessian matrices and Jacobians) of the cost function when approximated along the trajectory z with control trajectory u.\n",
    "5. Write the iLQR algorithm that solves the problem using the functions written above. At each iteration, for the line search, start with $\\alpha = 1.$ and decrease it by half when the cost does not improve (you can stop when $\\alpha < 0.01$).\n",
    "6. Test the algorithm using as initial guess $u$ such that the robot is at rest (cf. Part1.2). Analyze your results (probably you will need to \"tune\" your cost function), plot the initial and final state and control trajectories, show the animation. (use the simulation without perturbations for simplicity). What benefits and issues do you see with this approach?\n",
    "7. Use iLQR (and a new cost function) to get the quadrotor to do a full flip, trying to reach the upside-down state $x=1.3$, $y=3$ and $\\theta = \\pi$ at $t=5$ and upright state $x=3$, $y=3$ and $\\theta = \\pi$ at $t=10$. Analyze your results. What benefits and issues do you see with this approach? Could you run the resulting controller on a real robot?"
